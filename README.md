# Hecho Esta
Is a simple app demo for orders and shipments

## Install dependencies for backend
Go to the root of this project with the terminal and type `npm install`

## Install dependencies frontend
Go to the `angular-src` folder in the root and with the terminal type `npm install`

## MongoDB
The storage for this app is MongoDB. By default is configure to run in `mongodb://127.0.0.1/HechoEsta` locally.
You can change this configuration, going to the `config/database.js` file in the root.

## Run the server.
I recommend you to install nodemon globally and run the server by typing "nodemon" with the terminal in the root folder.
By default the server runs in `localhost:8080` but this if you build the angular app.

## Run the server for angular.
Go to the `angular-src` folder with the terminal and type `ng serve`. This command will run the server for the frontend. Go to `localhost:4200`.
